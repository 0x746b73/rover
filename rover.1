.SH CONCEPTS
.SS TABS
.PP
Rover is operated via a tabbed interface. At any given moment, one (and only
one) tab is visible on the screen. There are always ten tabs in total, numbered
from 0 to 9. The number of the tab currently visible is shown on the top right
corner of the screen. To view a different tab, one just needs to press its
corresponding number. Each tab has a \fBcurrent working directory\fR (\fBCWD\fR)
associated to it, also shown on the top of the screen. The \fBCWD\fR of the
visible tab is changed as the user navigates through the file system.
.PP
It's also possible to set the \fBCWD\fR of tabs at Rover start-up by passing the
desired paths as command-line arguments. The tab number 0 always starts at
\fB$HOME\fR. If more than nine directories are specified, only the first nine
are used for tabs 1\-9 and the rest is ignored. Tabs for which an invalid path
were assigned will also start at \fB$HOME\fR. Remaining tabs not specified on
the command line start at the current working directory of the parent process.
.SS ENTRIES
.PP
An \fBentry\fR is anything that may be found inside a directory in some file
system: a file, a directory, a link, a socket, a FIFO, etc. In its most basic
usage, Rover will gather the list of entries in a given directory and present
them on the screen, one per line.
.PP
There will always be one (and only one) highlighted entry visible. This is both
the \fBcursor\fR location and the current \fBselection\fR. The highlighting
moves as the user navigates the entry list with cursor commands. Simple
operations, like entering a subdirectory or renaming a file, are done by first
selecting the relevant entry and them using the appropriate command (see the
\fBCOMMANDS\fR section). For commands that operate on more than one entry at
once (batch commands), selection is not sufficient, since it's not possible to
select more than one entry. Batch commands are performed on marked entries.
.SS MARKS
.PP
For some file operations, it is convenient to first \fBmark\fR all entries that
are to be processed, so that the appropriate command only needs to be issued
once. For such purpose, Rover allows an arbitrary number of entries to be
marked, with the limitation that they must be all in the same directory.
.PP
Unlike simple selection, the effect of marks is not constrained by visibility.
This is so one can mark a number of entries in some directory, navigate to other
directory, and then finally issue a copy or move command. Moreover, marks are
shared over all tabs. This allows one to mark some entries in one tab that is
pointed to the "source" directory of the operation and then issue the command on
another tab that is pointed to the "destination" directory.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP

will not use or create any external file during its execution, except when asked
to do so by user commands.
.SH NOTES
.PP
\fBImportant\fR: Currently, Rover never asks for confirmation before overwriting
existing files while copying/moving marked entries. Please be careful to not
accidentally lose your data.
